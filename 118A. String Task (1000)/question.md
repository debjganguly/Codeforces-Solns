## 🧩 Problem Statement  

Petya started attending programming lessons. On his first lesson, he was asked to write a program that processes a given string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters in the following way:

1. Delete all vowels.  
2. Insert a character `.` before each consonant.  
3. Replace all uppercase consonants with corresponding lowercase ones.  

Vowels are: **A, O, Y, E, U, I** (both uppercase and lowercase).  
All other letters are considered consonants.  

The program takes exactly **one string** as input and should return a **single string** after processing.

---

## 📥 Input  

- A single line containing a string of length **1 to 100**, consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.

---

## 📤 Output  

- Print the resulting string after processing.  
- It is guaranteed that the output string will **not be empty**.

## 💬 Examples  

**Example 1**  

Input:
tour
Output:
.t.r

**Example 2**  

Input:
Codeforces
Output:
.c.d.f.r.c.s

**Example 3**  

Input:

## ⚙️ Constraints  

| Parameter | Limit |
|------------|--------|
| **Length of string** | 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 |
| **Time Limit** | 2 seconds |
| **Memory Limit** | 256 MB |

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway  

> This is a classic **string manipulation** problem — it tests your ability to carefully handle characters, apply transformations, and maintain order in strings.
