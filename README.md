# CodeforcesSolns

This repository contains solutions to the Codeforces problems Iâ€™ve solved on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com).

All solutions are written in **C++** and stored in a single folder.  
Thereâ€™s no categorization by difficulty, tags, or contests â€” just a simple dump of my accepted solutions.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, revise older problems, and practice competitive programming consistently.

Feel free to explore and learn â€” but don't just copy-paste. Solve, struggle, and grow. ðŸ’ª
